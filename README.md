</p>

`symbeam` is a pedagogical software package written in Python target at Mechanical, Civil and Industrial Engineering students learning the fundamentals of bending of beams, namely, bending diagrams and deflections.

The modular object-oriented-based design of `symbeam` combined with the excelent symbolic engine (SymPy)[https://www.sympy.org/pt/index.html], on which `symbeam` relies heavily, provides an unique computational learning environemnt for student grasping these concepts for the first time.
`symbeam` provides an easy mean assess the solutions of exercises for a wide variety of loadings and supports while allowing to quickly change the parameters of the problem fostering physical intuition.

On the other hand, `symbeam` can also be used by teachers to quickly create and validate new problems for classes and exams, faccilitating this sometimes cumbersome task.
